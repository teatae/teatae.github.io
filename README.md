Welcome to Tae's personal website!
==================================

![preview](https://github.com/teatae/teatae.github.io/blob/main/assets/preview.png?raw=true)
I took inspiration from this website: https://websitedemos.net/web-developer-portfolio-04/  
Please feel free to use my website to create your own, I've minified my css and javascript, the " - Copy" files are the un-minified versions.  
To minify HTML, JS and CSS; I've used respectively: http://kangax.github.io/html-minifier/, https://codebeautify.org/minify-js and https://www.minifier.org/.  
This website is single page, I used my NameCheap domain taetae.ca to host my github.io domain.  
I've also added my local weather.
